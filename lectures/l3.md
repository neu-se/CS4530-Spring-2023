### Learning Objectives:
This lecture is about writing code that other people will be able to understand, reuse, and modify.  We've distilled this down to five general program-design princples.

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:
* Describe the purpose of our design principles 
* List 5 code-level design principles with examples
* Identify some violations of the principles and suggest ways to mitigate them

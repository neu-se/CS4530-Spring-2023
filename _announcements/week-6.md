As part of software development process, each team is expected to use a structured development process, including pull requests, code reviews, etc. Each team will also submit sprint reports, individual/team surveys, have weekly meetings with TA Mentor. The development process started this week and the required submissions will start next week (we will have submissions for week 6, 8, 10-14). 

Here are important submissions to remember:
* Every week each student is expected to meet with their mentor for regularly scheduled meeting. Weekly Canvas assignments will help track your attendance in these meetings.
* Every week each student is expected to complete one (Confidential, Peer Evaluation) Survey. The link can be found under Canvas assignment. 
* At the end of each sprint, each team will submit a sprint report (and retrospective) through a Canvas assignment.
* TAs will also review your commits, PRs, code reviews regularly and will keep an eye on appropriate division of labor within the project team.

These assignments count towards "project process" part of the project which is worth 20% of the overall project grade.

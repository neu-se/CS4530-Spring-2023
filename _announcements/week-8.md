We have created github repositories for all projects and have added students to their repos. We have also pushed the starter code {for the project} to all repos under 'starter-code' branch. If you don't have access to your project repo yet, please be sure to [fill out the form](https://piazza.com/class/lajrlnpg2pxyd/post/534) to provide your github id and your group number. 

Midterm exam is scheduled for the first lecture of Week 10 (i.e., the week after Spring break - March 13-15). For all in-person sections, all students are expected to be present in the classroom to complete the exam. For the online section, exam will also be given during the regular class time. Please coordinate with your instructors if there is any issue with the schedule. Those who have DRC accommodations, please reach out to your instructors immediately to help coordinate your exam.  

As part of the exam review, we have provided some resources on Canvas (under Notes and Videos page). Please be sure to review those!

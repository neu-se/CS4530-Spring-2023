The [final project deliverables](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Spring-2023/assignments/project-deliverable) are now published. These include details regarding submission of the final project (i.e., code/testing, report, posters and demos). Canvas assignments for these are now available too.

We have also provided a [tutorial](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Spring-2023/tutorials/) on course website with details about how to setup your continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline for the project.

Each instructor will also provide detailed list of expectations for the final demos. Those may be viewed on piazza in next few weeks.

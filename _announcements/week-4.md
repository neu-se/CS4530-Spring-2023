Please complete this [Team Formation Survey](https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/133054/assignments/1752275) to help us organize you into a team for the term project. EVERY STUDENT must fill this form out by 11am on Wednesday 2/1/2023, or risk being placed in a random team.

You may select between 1-3 other students that you would like to be teamed with (this works best if the other students indicate this preference, too). We will take your preferences of who to work with into consideration when forming teams, but make NO guarantees that all requests for team mates can be accommodated.

You may also share names of students that you would like us to avoid teaming you with in all circumstances (particularly useful to specify the constraint of: "I want to work with X, please find 2 more team mates for us, do not team us with Y or Z"). If you list students who you do not want to work with, we will try our best to ensure that you are not teamed with them.

Note: For your project, you can only work with students who are in the same section!

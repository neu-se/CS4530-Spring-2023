The first [individual project deliverable](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Spring-2023/assignments/ip1) is now available. This deliverable is due by January 25th at 11am ET. Your work will be submitted on Gradescope which can be accessed through Canvas. Please note the autograding script will impose a strict rate limit of 5 submissions per 24 hours. This limit exists to encourage you to start early on this assignment. Feel free to use piazza to ask questions and use office hours if you need help. We have 105 hours of scheduled TA office hours per week.

A video to help you setup your IDE and get started with the Covey.Town codebase will be available tomorrow. We are also working on setting up the auto grader and it should be ready by Thursday.

## React Activity - Todo Tracker

This activity is intended to supplement the CS4530 lecture on React and it will let you practice with `useState` to create a simple todo tracker.

### Steps

To get started, download the [starter Code]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link Activities/module07-react-todo.zip %}). Run the command `npm install`, and then `npm start`. The development server should start, and your browser should open showing the handout code.

The goal of this activity is to enhance the starter code so that:
* The "Add TODO item" will add a new item to the list
* The "Delete" icon will delete an item from the list
* Add a "Delete all" button, that will delete all items from the list

After Module 8, you might also consider the following objective:
* After the list of todo items changes, display a [toast](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/toast) confirming that the todo list has changed.

When you are done, submit your work as required by your instructor.  This may vary from section to section.

This activity will introduce you to an important step in software development life cycle known as requirement engineering. You will be using user stories to solicit and document user requireemtns and will then refine those into conditions of satisfaction and then assign priorities.

Before we get started, be sure to review the tutorial on "User Stories and Conditions of Satisfaction" posted on the course website.


Here is the example user story you will be working with:
As a customer of Southwest Airline, I would like to retrieve my luggage so that I can have my jewelry back.

Here is what you should do for this activity:
* Write atleast 3 conditions of satisfaction with appropriate priority and then write 3 bad examples.

When you are done, submit your work as required by your instructor.
